# Personal Portfolio

Welcome! My name is Andr√© Rodrigues and I'm a Front-End Developer. As a junior developer, I methodically push myself further to learn more, being updated and close to the community. I have worked on a multitude of web and print-based projects providing Web Design, Mobile-First Approach, Development, and Graphic Design concepts. Here are some of my favourites projects, so I hope you enjoy them and all feedback is welcome :)
